### Development of the App
#### Step 1:
<p>Making the base on a Web Page due to being the only way i knew how to make it, using Angular and making a NestJS project</p>
<p>All of the assets used on the project were designed on Figma by me, except for the animation of the background, that was taken from this page: </p>

<p>Right now is almost finished, i just need to connect some endpoints</p>
