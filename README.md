### Development of the App
#### Phase 1:
<p>The birth of the idea</p>
<p>I neglected myself for some time so i tried to get back on my feet by tracking healthy habits and getting some work on myself, i started to use a Notion template for it using the gamification method of showing graphs and colors so i can motivate myself, the downside: i only had the Free plan of Notion so its very limited</p>

<p>So the idea of doing an app came to my mind, im a Web developer, how hard can it be?</p>

#### Phase 2:
<p>Designing the idea</p>
<p>For the first version of the app a came with the idea of using it daily, so i must use colors that doesnt give some "eye sore" everytime it opens, so i leaned to dark tones of purple that bring relaxation to the user (Me)</p>

<p>But i didn´t like the outcome, it looked cartoonish and simple, so i reworked the design by researching about design styles, to setting down with the "Glassmorphism" style with a touch of galactic vibe</p>

#### Phase 3:
<p>Creating the app (Web Version)</p>
<p>Making the base on a Web Page due to being the only way i knew how to make it, using Angular and making a NestJS project</p>
<p>All of the assets used on the project were designed on Figma by me, except for the animation of the background, that was taken from this page: </p>

<p>And changed a little to fit the idea i had in mind</p>

<p>Finished!!! 19-Feb-2026</p>

#### Phase 4:
<p>Creating the app (Desktop Version)</p>
<p>The Front-End is prepared to be packaged with Electron-Builder with the Back-End deployed on Vercel</p>
<p>Its almost finished, im working on the tweaking of somethings on the Back-End side before deploying it on Vercel</p>

#### Phase 5:
<p>Creating the app (Mobile Version)</p>
<p>The plan is to also turn this into a Mobile App using Cordova</p>
