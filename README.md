-----------
### Development of the App
#### Step 1:
<p>Making the base on a Web Page due to being the only way i knew how to make it, using Angular and making a NestJS project</p>
<p>All of the assets used on the project were designed on Figma by me, except for the animation of the background, that was taken from this page: </p>
<a href=https://wweb.dev/resources/animated-css-background-generator>Animation Page</a>
<p>And changed a little to fit the idea i had in mind</p>

<p>Finished!!! 19-Feb-2026</p>

#### Step 2:
<p>The Front-End is prepared to be packaged with Electron-Builder with the Back-End deployed on Vercel</p>
<p>Its almost finished, im working on the tweaking of somethings on the Back-End side before deploying it on Vercel</p>

#### Step 3:
<p>The plan is to also turn this into a Mobile App using Cordova</p>
